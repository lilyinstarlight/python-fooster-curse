## Usage

    $ pip install fooster-curse
    $ curse file.py

Output is still a valid Python program with identical function[1] and maintains API compatibility despite identifiers being mangled and with the same identifier mangled differently for each occurrence in the file.

<sup>[1] Technically it will have different function if non-identifiers in the input file aren't ascii but that is due to a workaround put in place to allow cursing already cursed files since [Baron does not like non-ascii identifiers](https://github.com/PyCQA/baron/issues/164)</sup>


## Rule of Three Clause

Mind the Three-fold Laws you should three times bad and three times good.
When misfortune is enow wear the star upon your brow.

Be true in love this you must do unless your love is false to you.

These Eight words the Rede fulfill:
"An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye Will"
